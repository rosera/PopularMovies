### Prerequisites

The project requires the Volley library and a valid TMDB API key to compile and run. Load Volley into the project directory. An empty folder marked Volley is the one in which the Volley project should be loaded.

Note: 
Volley has now been moved to the following location: https://github.com/google/volley
A valid TMDB API key can be accessed via the TMDB website.
